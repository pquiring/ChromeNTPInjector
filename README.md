# ChromeNTPInjector
Overrides Chrome's NewTab Page by injecting new content but keeps the bookmark bar in place.

Edit n.js to change the content placed in your new tab page and load into Chrome.

Hopefully someone can fork this project and build an editable Speed Dial page that will work with NTP but keep Chrome's bookmark bar.
So many NTP replacements are missing the bookmark bar.
