# ChromeNTPInjector
Overrides Chrome's NewTab Page by injecting new content but keeps the bookmark bar in place.

You can now edit the content in the Options page.

Gives you that chrome://apps feel with the bookmark bar that Google screwed up with NTP.

Hopefully someone can fork this project and build an editable Speed Dial page similar to chrome://apps
that will work with NTP but keep Chrome's bookmark bar.
So many NTP replacements are missing the bookmark bar.
